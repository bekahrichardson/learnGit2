    <h1>My Practice File</h1>
     <p>This is to see if I actually know how to work with Github.</p>
     <p>I have forgotten a lot of creating new documents and such in Github and having
     it connect correctly to my terminal. That was always confusing for me, so I will
     be doing little test/practice projects such as this to make sure my projects actually
     save where they are supposed to on my account.</p>
