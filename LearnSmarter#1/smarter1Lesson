    <h1>My Practice File</h1>
    <p class="important">Warning: we have no slow lorises here</p>
     <p>This is to see if I actually know how to work with Github.</p>
     <p>I have forgotten a lot of creating new documents and such in Github and having
     it connect correctly to my terminal. That was always confusing for me, so I will
     be doing little test/practice projects such as this to make sure my projects actually
     save where they are supposed to on my account.</p>
    <h2 class="typewriter">My Life</h2>
     <p class="typewriter">I am currently around 36 weeks pregnant. My doctor said that I am measuring a week
     ahead though, so I could actually be having this baby sooner that we thought. I am married
     to a wonderful man Aaron and we have a cute baby about to come to our family. Just a few
     more weeks of waiting! (or days!)<br>I also am currently a student in coding school, specifically
     DevMountain. JavaScript is really hard for me to learn, so I am just taking baby steps through
     the course.<br> I also work semi-full time. I work more than 20 hours a week but because of studies,
     I am not able to work 40 hours or as many hours as I would like to, but I am working on that. I am
     a writer for a company that manages a bunch of blogs and social media sites for different companies.
     Everything is online and so I work from home. It is a really good gig and one that I can do with a
     baby at home.</p>
